now as you can see there's going to be a
lot to actually managing all the
contracts that we work with having to
write our own compile code our own
storage code is going to take a lot of
work and what if we wanted to interact
with one of the contracts that we
deployed in the past well we'd have to
keep track of all those addresses and
manually update our address features
here with an address maybe we didn't
want to deploy a new contract every
single time maybe we want to work with a
contract that we've already deployed
what if we want to work with a whole
bunch of different chains what if we
want to work with rink b and mainnet and
our own local network there seems to be
a lot to manage here and we still
haven't even talked about writing tests
this is where brownie is going to come
into play brownie is currently the most
popular smart contract development
platform built based on python it's used
by d5 giants like yearn.finance
curve.phi and out each having billions
of dollars currently locked in value and
the reason that we learned a little bit
about web3.pi first is because brownie


 the build folder tracks a lot of
really important low-level information
it's going to track any interfaces that
we're working with or deploying it's
going to keep track of all of our
deployments across all of the different
chains so we no longer have to manage
that ourselves
and it's going to store all the compiled
code remember how in our simple storage
code we actually saved everything to
this compile code.json well brownie is
actually going to do all of that for us
into this contracts directory so we can
always reference it later this contracts
directory outside the build folder is
where we're going to put all of our
contracts brownie knows to look inside
of this folder when looking for new
contracts to compile deploy or anything
else interfaces is where we can save and
store different interfaces remember how
when we were working with chain link
working with interfaces makes it really
easy to interact with a blockchain
application reports are to save any type
of report you run scripts or we can
automate tasks like deploying calling
different functions or really anything
we want and then we have a test folder
which is incredibly powerful and we're

brownie access automatically ganache

brownie keeps tracts of all thye deploys across all the different chanins

interface makes easy to interact with blockcahin

BROWNIE SHELL SCRIPTS

>>> brownie init

>>> brownie compile

>>> brownie accounts new nameOfAccount

>>> brownie accounts list

>>> brownie accounts delete nameOfAccount

>>> brownie run scripts/name.py

>>> brownie test

>>> brownie test -s

>>> brownie test -k nameOfTest

>>> brownie test --pdb
(openn python shell, debugging)

>>> brownie networks list

>>> brownie run scripts/name.py --network rinnkeby

=====================================================================================================================

BROWNIE ADD

>>> brownie accounts new account-name
account = accounts.load("name of account")

or

accounts.add(config["wallets"]["from_key"])
accounts.add(os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY"))

=====================================================================================================================

>>> brownie accounts new account-name
account = accounts.load("name of account")

best way to store your key
brownie password encrypts yout keys

env variable are still faster, less secure tho
never put your private key: You should not trust yourself that much

encrypt command line

=====================================================================================================================

functions that write on the blockchain always need _from as a parameter

=====================================================================================================================

security is important in solidity
need to write testings
once the code is deployed it cannot be changed

=====================================================================================================================

TESTINNG FRAMEWORK arrange act assert

=====================================================================================================================

>>> brownie networks list

every network under "development env" will be torn down after execution
ethereum one will be persistent

=====================================================================================================================

brownie cann connnect with infura networks

account[0] only works with ganache CLI

stored_value = simple_storage.retrieve()  # no from field sice it's a view function
transaction = simple_storage.store(15, {"from": account}) # transaction needs from field
transaction.wait(1)  # how many block we want to wait

=====================================================================================================================

brownie console

brownie shell is a python shell with all of our smart contract features already natively integrated. very powerful

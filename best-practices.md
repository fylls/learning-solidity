use the smallest uint possibile
it cost less

ordering any of the global variables
that you put in your smart contract is
very important
it would not make sense if you had the
boolean value stored in between
these
integer types
as well as let's take it out there
as well as if an address was declared
and you put it in between here
the reason is because when the compiler
runs through the code it has to now do
extra work to work out where all these
addresses live and what data type they
are
your program will still function as
normal but to optimize it
please try and always keep the different
types that you declare
inside their respective
bubbles if i can put it like that just
order them right after each other for



Don't store sensitive information here anything is visible on the blockchain









contract.balance


if payable you ca use .transfer()


this = cotract.address
